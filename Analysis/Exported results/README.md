# Export

In this section, the created tables are exported to .csv files with the sme names. The created tables being exported are:
* pl_player_stats
* team_stats
* league_table

Reason for the export is to be able to carry out the data visualization portion in Tableau Public as this tool does not have the capability of adding a PostgreSQL database as a connection but has the capability to add excel files.

The export is carried out in the query **exporting_csv**
