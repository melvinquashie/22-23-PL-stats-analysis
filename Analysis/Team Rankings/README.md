# Team Rankings/ League Table
In this section, we use created table: team_stats along with Official Premier League scoring rules to generate the final league table. 
We then compare with the actual League Table (from real life) for any differences. Noting that the differences are due to the raw data used.

Given the following  Premier League scoring rules:
* Win = 3 points
* Draw = 1 point
* Loss = 0 points

Also given that the official league table contains the following columns:
* Team rank = "Rk"
* Club or Team name
* Number of games played = "PL"
* Team wins = "W"
* Team draws = "D"
* Team losses = "L"
* Team goal difference = "GD"
* Team points = "Pts"

With the use of arithmetic, creating derived columns, the 2022/23 Premier League Table is generated.
